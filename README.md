A Chess Game

Drag the pieces to move. The colors automatically switch.

This program allows you to make any kind of legal chess move that I know of, including pawn promotion, castling, and en passant. This program detects checkmate, draw by stalemate, draw by threefold repetition, draw by insufficient mating material, and draw by the 50-move rule.

All of this was coded by me from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I did not use any outside libraries.

Thanks.
